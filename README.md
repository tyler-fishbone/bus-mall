# bus-mall

## Overview

This project will be an application for a skymall like magazine to use to determine which of its potential products are the most likely to sell. This magazine will then go onto Puget Sound Regional Transit System Busses.

It is a project for learning more about HTML CSS and JavaScript, specifically clicktracking.

## Contents

The user will be shown 3 pictures will be prompted to click on the one of the three that they would be most likely to buy. They will then click on that picture to choose it. Then three more pictures will show up and they will repeat the process. This will happen 10 times before a chart is deisplayed with their results. They can then choose to keep selecting images and at multiples of 10 the chart below will refresh.

Some specifics:
* no picture will be shown in back to back sets
* the pictures will be displayed in order from most to least popular
* the site will feature messages like "halfway done" and "five more to go" when markers are reached
* The pictures will all appear the same size
* the results will show:
  * how many times the pictures were clicked on
  * the percentage of times the picture was clicked on when shown
